## Short Description about app

### UIKit Part

In this simple game app, I spent more time on Storyboard positioning elements and designing it. With help of UIButton, I could get style I want like placing image 
inside and changing border and it's color. Actually I created 3 UIViewController with almost same UI principles. Creating 2 view controller can be a little bit 
chalenging because of dynamically changing 3 buttons according to user selection and its delay.


### Logic Part

First of all, in the main view controller I created IBOutlets of UI Buttons
